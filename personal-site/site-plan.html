			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>My purpose is to present a gallary of photos I've taken in the past. This won't have my own photos yet, but there will be place holder images of cats instead. I want it to be very minimalist and clean.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience is anyone who is interested in photos. I don't want mym focus to be too narrow, but I want photos of natural beauty.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I want it to be very minimal and clean. Photos will grow larger when hovered over, and a carosel that has random images from my gallery will appear on the home page. FOr the mobile version, I want a hamburger menu and a button on the home page that will scroll down to the gallery portion.</p>

            <p>Hello, I'm Andrew Lewis, a passionate photographer and web developer hailing from the beautiful state of Wisconsin. My journey in the world of photography began with a simple love for capturing the breathtaking landscapes and unique moments that make life extraordinary. Over the years, this passion has evolved into a profound artistic endeavor, where I strive to convey the essence of my subjects through my lens. As a web developer, I blend my technical skills with my artistic eye, creating visually stunning and user-friendly websites that showcase not only my work but also the stories and experiences of my clients.</p>
			<p>When I'm not behind the camera or immersed in code, you can find me enjoying the serene beauty of Wisconsin with my wonderful spouse. Our shared adventures and experiences continually inspire my work, driving me to explore new perspectives and creative techniques. I believe that every photograph and every line of code has the potential to tell a compelling story, and it's this belief that fuels my dedication to both photography and web development. Thank you for visiting my gallery and taking the time to learn a little more about me and my creative journey.</p>
